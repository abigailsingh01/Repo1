# RepoMeta

For Repo1, I researched how to create a repository using terminal. I used GitHub documentation. I created a repository on GitHub and followed the guidelines. I changed the current working directory to my local project. Then I initialized the local directory as a Git repository. Next, I added the files in my new local repository. Then I commit the files that I've staged in my local repository. Then I copy the remote repository URL. Next, I added the URL for the remote repository where my local repository will be pushed. Then I pushed the changes in my local repository to GitHub. Next I added my project and pushed the changes in my local repository. 


For Repo2, it was a little bit harder to do find documentation. But then I found a really good cheat sheet that helped me. I created a subversion repository. I used nano to help me add and make changes to the repository. Then I commit the changes to your repo. Next I updated my repository. This cheat site helped me alot: https://articles.assembla.com/en/articles/1520163-adding-unversioned-files-to-your-svn-repository
